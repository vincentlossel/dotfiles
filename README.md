# Dotfiles

This repository contains some config files for programs that I actively use.
It is managed by [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/). Everything should work out of the box on macOS.


## Requirements

### Main Tools
- Dependency manager: [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
- Window manager: [Aerospace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace)
- Shell: ZSH (with [Oh My ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/))
- Terminal: [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)
- Editor: [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)

### Other
- Main Fonts: JetBrains Mono (Nerd Font), Zed Mono (Nerd Font)
- Themes: Catppuccin Mocha (with some custom modifications)


## How to use
You can pick any file for a specific tool and use it directly.
If you want to use the whole configuration, you should learn more about [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io).

If you are not using macOS, some modifications might be required.
